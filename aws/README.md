# AWS

## Troubleshooting  

Make sure different versions of clients are the same version, sometimes deleting `yarn.lock` then re-installing fixes weird errors.

## ENV Variables

Add any environment variables relevant to `.env.local` and to `.env`. Then make sure to add a new entry in Vercel directly. Then make sure to store somewhere.
